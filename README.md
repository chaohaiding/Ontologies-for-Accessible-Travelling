## Ontology for Transportation 

- [TRANSIT](http://vocab.org/transit/terms/.html): A vocabulary for describing transit systems and routes . The TRANSIT schema is based on the General Transit Feed Specification published by Google. (deprecated)

- [Linked GTFS](https://github.com/OpenTransport/linked-gtfs): The Linked General Transit Feed Specification (Linked GTFS) is a mapping of the GTFS in CSV reference towards RDF. It stays as close as possible to the CSV reference, including small additions to enhance usability.

- [PASSIM ontology](http://data.lirmm.fr/ontologies/passim) This ontology is the description of the operation of a transport information service. 
    1. Accessibility Property: passim:isAccessibilityForDisabledPerson,
    2. passim:isWebSiteAccessibilityForDisabledPerson
